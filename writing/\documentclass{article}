Studying the learnability of formal languages of known structure can be useful
to gain insight into the way that certain types of machine learning models, 
especially LSTM based RNN, generalise when dealing with natural languahe stimuli.
However the choice of grammar has not received much attention, with many researchers using simple
examples like $a^nb^n$.
Here we discuss this issue.
